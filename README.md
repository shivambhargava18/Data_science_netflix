## 🔍 Project Overview

With over 6,000+ titles analyzed, this project investigates:

- ✅ Genre distribution and spikes
- ✅ Regional production trends
- ✅ Content gaps for strategic acquisition

Using this analysis, we developed a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a title is a *Movie* or *TV Show* based on its attributes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**  
- **Pandas & NumPy**  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

- Analyzed over **6,000 Netflix titles** for patterns in genre, release year, and country of origin.
- Created a **Random Forest model** with over **85% accuracy** in predicting content type.
- Designed **data visualizations and dashboards** to make insights more accessible for stakeholders.
